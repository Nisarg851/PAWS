# PAWS
## Platform for Anonymous WistleBlowing Securely

Expose corruption and misconduct without exposing yourself. PAWS provides a secure, anonymous platform for whistleblowers to share evidence and collaborate with others.

## Mission
PAWS exists to empower individuals to safely expose corruption, misconduct, and unethical behavior without fear of retaliation. We believe that transparency is essential for a just society, and that whistleblowers play a crucial role in holding power to account.

By providing a secure platform for anonymous reporting, we aim to reduce the personal risk faced by those who speak truth to power, while ensuring that important information reaches the public.

## Vision
We envision a world where corruption and misconduct cannot thrive in secrecy, where those who witness wrongdoing have a safe channel to report it, and where the public has access to information that powerful interests might prefer to keep hidden.

PAWS strives to be the most trusted, secure, and effective platform for whistleblowers worldwide, continuously improving our security measures and user experience to better serve those who take risks to expose the truth.
